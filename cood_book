#step 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
train -- all value of train
test -- all value of test
combined -- combination of train and test

# Step 2 determine which columns contain "mean()" or "std()"
meanstdcols is  col wiyh mean and standard deviation
combined1  all data having mean and standard deviation.

## STEP 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities
## in the data set.
## STEP 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive
## activity names. 

# convert the activity column from integer to factor
combined1$activity 
## STEP 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
## average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# create the tidy data set
melted  subset
tidy is having final data
